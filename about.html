        Every now and then we bump into the trouble of not finding a high
        quality movie when we want to watch it. Every so often we hear about
        great indie films, but cannot seem to find it when we are looking. That
        is what we are here for. Connecting Film-Lovers. We want to be the
        bridge that takes you from interessted in movies, to watching the
        greates and the up and coming. We want to be the video streaming website
        where you can purchase high-quality videos directly from the people who
        make them.
